#Unit 1: Learning Objectives

##PCM1a

•	Define the terms parameter, population, statistic, and sample
•	Identify common notation used for describing samples and populations
•	Explain the concept of statistical inference
•	Differentiate between type of data – qualitative vs quantitative
•	Calculate numerical summaries of quantitative variables
•	Identify potential sampling issues like undercoverage and nonresponse bias
•	Explain the term selection bias and why we want to avoid it
•	Introduce the Simple Random Sample technique

##PCM1b

•	Visualize distribution of variables graphically using histograms and probability density plots
•	Define basic probabilities rules involving union, intersection, and complement.
•	Identify types of random variables
•	Explain the concept of sampling distribution for a sample proportion
•	Introduce probability mass function (PMF), probability density function (PDF), and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

##PCM1c

•	Define a point estimate and a point estimator
•	Identify the appropriate point estimator in context 
•	Explain variability in a point estimate using standard error and margin of error
•	Define a Confidence Interval (CI) and confidence level
•	Explain the relationship of a confidence interval and margin of error
•	Construct confidence interval for proportions
