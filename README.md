Justin to-do list:

- Put in video of simulation using lock 5 or something in PCM4b, 4.9  


Kiran to-do list:

- Remove prev/next button/swipe functionality on first slide  
- Remove next button/swipe functionality on Each "Take the quiz?" slide  
- Remove next button/swipe functionality on Each "Quiz Time!" slide  

- Go through and pull out all slide names and put into an excel document (1 new file of names in the landing page of the repo)  
- Google analytics added as a trigger to each slide (will correspond to the names of the slides)  (In Progress)
- Go through quiz questions, make sure they are set up correctly in articulate, check answers & relevance of questions, check behavior once on moodle  
- Remove all module objectives (usually 2nd slide if they are there), but keep them in a file, *create* the objectives after looking through the module for those that don't have them.  These will be placed on the moodle site rather than within the module itself. (1 new file of objectives in the landing page of the repo)  (Completed!)

- PCM1b  (Completed!) 

    + Extra examples in PCM1b part 1 not there, PCM1b part 2 are not formatted nicely (need latex) and some spacing fixes, slide names changed?  
    + Review part (last bit) doesn't have any points to it (a message about writing key points was placed there apparently) 
    
- PCM1c (Completed!)

    + Extra examples in PCM1c need formatted a little better, slide names changed?  
    + PCM1c the last review part doesn't have any points to it 

- PCM2a  

    + Extra examples need to be less text and more bullet pointy, slide names changed?   
    + Maybe a recap slide prior to the examples  
    + Extra examples on the second section don't seem relevant  
    + Check to make sure review points are relevant, if not, add them in  
    
- PCM2b  

    + Review points are not relevant so that needs to be updated  
    + Extra examples could be formatted better, slide names changed  

- PCM2c  

    + Review points are not relevant so that needs to be updated  
    + Extra examples could be formatted better, slide names changed  
    
- PCM3a  

    + Look over extra examples. (Review points are correct here.)  
    
- PCM3b  

    + Extra examples don't seem to be changed...  (Review points are correct here.)   
- PCM3c  

    + Review points need to be updated  
    + Extra examples looked at as well  

- PCM4a  

    + Review points are up to date, but maybe rework them a little  
    + Extra examples should be standardized and maybe shortened a bit?  
    + Extra example for second part isn't updated  
    
- PCM4b  

    + Take Extra examples and quiz bank questions from PCM4bold and put them into PCM4b (I added a scene and the easist way to do so was to just copy a file that already had three scenes).  There won't be anything corresponding to the third part, that will need to be created.  Also, the examples and quiz questions for parts 1 and 2 of PCM4b may need to be redone...  
    + Review points need to be updated  

- PCM 4c  

    + Definitely need to test out all of the "paths" for Unit 4 modules.  I think some got messed up when Brooke created them...  
    + I removed one section of slides there.  The quiz questions and extra examples may be relevant - I'm not sure.  
    
- PCM 5a  

    + Review points are good but extra examples and quiz questions need to be looked at  
    
- PCM 5b  

    + Review points need to be updated  
    + Extra examples and quiz questions looked at  

- PCM 5c  

    + Review points need to be updated  
    + Extra examples and quiz questions looked at  
    + For the third section of the module (part 4) I didn't update the example from unit 2c.  Please put in a new matched pairs CI example here (similar to what is done in part 1 of the module).  
    
- PCM 6  

    + All the usual things need to be done for PCM6: extra examples, new quiz questions, recap slides 
    




Note: 1c has some extra slides about SE of the mean and what not
